# ktlsp

A Rust-only Kotlin language server under development, targeting feature parity with official `kotlin-lsp/v263.6379.0`. Full parity has **not** been achieved.

## Build and run

The repository pins Rust 1.99.0. With Rust/rustup and the platform linker installed:

```sh
cargo build --locked --release -p ktlsp-server --bin ktlsp
./target/release/ktlsp
```

With no arguments, `ktlsp` reads and writes Content-Length-framed LSP on stdio. Configure an editor's server command to the built executable with no arguments. Use `--help` or `--version` for CLI output. It needs no JVM or JDK for this core operation.

## Current behavior

The server implements initialization/shutdown/exit and bounded, versioned UTF-16 document synchronization, including atomic multi-edit rollback. It advertises synchronization only. Unsupported language requests return method-not-found; completion, hover, semantic diagnostics, navigation, formatting and refactoring remain unimplemented.

Separate Rust libraries provide a bounded lossless Kotlin lexer, stdio framing and validated explicit project-model v1 loading. Lexer and project-model providers are not yet integrated into editor requests or live build import. Limits and residual gaps are documented in [parity status](docs/status/parity.md).

The native server, build and core editor analysis require no JVM, JDK, Kotlin compiler, JNI or C/C++ parser. Optional future Gradle/Maven import/build/run/debug may use the user's existing Java tools; no Java is bundled. See [runtime boundary](docs/specs/runtime-boundary.md).

## Development

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --workspace
```

Read [research](docs/research/official.md), [specifications](docs/specs/parity.md), [plan](docs/PLAN.md), [tickets](docs/TICKETS.md), and [handoff instructions](docs/HANDOFF.md) before continuing implementation. Unsupported language and project behavior must remain explicit.
